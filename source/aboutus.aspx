    Airline Reservation System is a web portal to book airline ticket online. The objective
    of the project is to design an Airline Reservation System application which enables
    the customers to search and book flights. The Airline Reservation System project
    mainly consists of two types of users. The customers who access the information
    provided by the ARS website and the administrator who modifies and updates the information
    available in the website. The Airline Reservation System project is an implementation
    of a general Airline Ticketing website, which helps the customers to search the
    availability and prices.

    This project also covers various features like online registration of the users,
    modifying the details of the website by the management staff or administrator of
    the website, by adding, deleting or modifying the customer details, flights or packages
    information. In general, this website would be designed to perform like any other
    airline ticketing website available online.
